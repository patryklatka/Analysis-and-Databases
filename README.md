# Analysis and Databases

In this repository, I wanted to present some of the exercises that I made in the "Analysis and Databases" course in my studies. It helped me learn the basics of the R language and the PostgreSQL database. The tasks used a database from the official PostgreSQL tutorial available [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/). And also the popular nycflights13 database and databases posted in the repository.
